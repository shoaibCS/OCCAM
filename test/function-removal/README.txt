--remove-functions can be used to pass functions to be removed and inform OCCAM that RemoveFunctions pass has to be invoked.

if anyone wants to remove function add and mul, he can pass the flag --remove-functions=add,mul to slash. if the specified function is not in bitcode provided, nothing would happen.
